# CryptoClustering
This project performs a market segmentation analysis using K-Means clustering on scaled customer data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to three principal components, preserving approximately 89.5% of the original variance. The elbow method is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters, which is identified as 4. The results are visualized to show the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering, highlighting the trade-off between improved visualization and potential loss of subtle data patterns. This approach helps uncover meaningful customer groupings for better strategic insights.
